","Perhaps you think fairies are figments of the imagination, or even relics of an ancient past. You may even think all fairies are lovely winged creatures, who dance in bluebell fields, granting wishes to anyone who should encounter them. 
You would be wrong on all counts. 
Fairies are very much alive today, and they are everywhere - in our cities, our backyards, and even our kitchen cupboards. Some of them are indeed the sweet-tempered, winged creatures of folklore, but the fairy family also includes goblins, trolls, brownies, and other strange creatures, some of which are revealed to humans in this book for the very first time. While many fairy breeds are harmless, others can be quite nasty or even dangerous.
In this luxuriously illustrated guidebook, preeminent fairy expert Miss Edythe McFate shares her knowledge of the modern fairy world and includes practical advice on matters such as how to tell a good fairy from a bad one, how to spot a “fairy ring,” how to tell the difference between dwarves and trolls (one species isfar deadlier than the other), and how to defend against fairies who would do you harm. Also included are eight true cautionary tales about children who have encountered fairies in ultramodern New York City.

Graphic Thiết kế using limited or single colors not only offers a less expensive alternative to costly four and five color printing but also offers a range of bold effects from somber and elegant to edgy and bold. As the saying goes, less is more, and the work that is showcased in these pages clearly illustrates the truth and merit in this saying.

One-color and two-color printing, although more common than four-color printing, often carries with it a stigma of looking cheap compared to four-color pieces. This book puts that myth to rest by showing how truly dynamic effects can be achieved with simple, inexpensive one- and two-color Thiết kế and printing. Besides its simplicity, it has a style all its own, which can convey sophistication, elegance, and integrity.

Included is a color finder section Thiết kếed to show readers a variety of color combinations for various projects such as logos, packaging, book jackets, and posters. Each featured project is shown in thumbnail size in 15 to 20 different single or two-color combinations.",Từ 13 tuổi trở lên

I'm always trying to figure out what's really going on. Always having to fill in the gaps, but never getting all the details. It's like trying to do a jigsaw when I don't even know what the picture is, and I'm missing one of the vital middle pieces.

How do you know if your friends are talking about you being your back, or if a boy likes you? They could act all innocent, but you'd know from the rumors. You'd hear the whispers. But what if you couldn't hear those whispers anymore? Being a teenager is hard enough. But what about being a deaf teenager? Demi is 15 years old when her world is shattered by illness. Waking up in hospital, she can see people are talking and moving around her, but she can hear nothing. As the days and weeks pass, it becomes clear that Demi is locked in a silent world and this is a world she must now learn to navigate. This unique, touching story explores the universal theme of finding your place, against a fascinating backdrop.",Từ 13 tuổi trở lên

","Wuthering Heights, first published in 1847, the year before the author's death at the age of thirty, endures today as perhaps the most powerful and intensely original novel in the English language. “Only Emily Brontë,” V.S. Pritchett said about the author and her contemporaries, “exposes her imagination to the dark spirit.” And Virginia Woolf wrote, “It is as if she could tear up all that we know human beings by, and fill these unrecognisable transparencies with such a gust of life that they transcend reality. Hers, then, is the rarest of all powers. She could free life from its dependence on facts, with few touches indicate the spirit of a face so that it needs no body; by speaking of the moor make the wind blow and the thunder roar.”",Từ 13 tuổi trở lên
