Sunflower is an only child, and when her father is sent to the rural Cadre School, she has to go with him. Her father is an established artist from the city and finds his new life of physical labor and endless meetings exhausting. Sunflower is lonely and longs to play with the local children in the village across the river. When her father tragically drowns, Sunflower is taken in by the poorest family in the village, a family with a son named Bronze.

Bronze and Sunflower become inseparable, understanding each other as only the closest friends can. Translated from Mandarin, the story meanders gracefully through the challenges that face the family, creating a timeless story of the trials of poverty and the power of love and loyalty to overcome hardship.","A beautifully written, timeless tale by Cao Wenxuan, best-selling Chinese author and 2016 recipient of the prestigious Hans Christian Andersen Award.

One of these individuals is the very person who brought the scattered Indian subcontinent under the reign of Chandragupta Maurya-Chanakya. Chanakya is one of the wisest political strategists to have ever lived in the history of India. The second protagonist is Gangasagar Mishra, who is a rather insignificant Brahmin teacher, who seems to be struggling to make ends meet, but is actually a reincarnation of Chanakya himself.
The author gives you an intricately woven plot that is set in two parallel worlds, but is tied together by its two protagonists, namely Chanakya and Gangasagar. Chanakya's tale, set in 340BC, is a tale of revenge that Chanakya seeks against the king and how he brings in Chandragupta Maurya to take over the throne. The second tale, based in modern-day India is that of Gangasagar grooming a young girl from Kanpur, to eventually become the prime minister of India.

It's soon clear that Sophie's future is very much wrapped up in the details of her family's past, and the key lies with information only one man can provide: her parents' former employer, the elusive billionaire Alfred Nobel.

Some of them are indeed the sweet-tempered, winged creatures of folklore, but the fairy family also includes goblins, trolls, brownies, and other strange creatures, some of which are revealed to humans in this book for the very first time. While many fairy breeds are harmless, others can be quite nasty or even dangerous.
In this luxuriously illustrated guidebook, preeminent fairy expert Miss Edythe McFate shares her knowledge of the modern fairy world and includes practical advice on matters such as how to tell a good fairy from a bad one, how to spot a “fairy ring,” how to tell the difference between dwarves and trolls (one species isfar deadlier than the other), and how to defend against fairies who would do you harm.

Graphic Thiết kế using limited or single colors not only offers a less expensive alternative to costly four and five color printing but also offers a range of bold effects from somber and elegant to edgy and bold. As the saying goes, less is more, and the work that is showcased in these pages clearly illustrates the truth and merit in this saying.

One-color and two-color printing, although more common than four-color printing, often carries with it a stigma of looking cheap compared to four-color pieces. This book puts that myth to rest by showing how truly dynamic effects can be achieved with simple, inexpensive one- and two-color Thiết kế and printing. Besides its simplicity, it has a style all its own, which can convey sophistication, elegance, and integrity.

Included is a color finder section Thiết kếed to show readers a variety of color combinations for various projects such as logos, packaging, book jackets, and posters. Each featured project is shown in thumbnail size in 15 to 20 different single or two-color combinations.","Explores ways to stretch a budget by using limited colors without compromising style.

simple,,Wuthering Heights,1,0,visible,"Nelly Dean has spent her life serving the inhabitants of Wuthering Heights. She has quite a tale to tell. She wants to tell it to you.

Nelly’s story is as wild and stormy as the moors on which it is set. She talks of haunting, hatred, love, grief and the desire for revenge.

Her tale begins and ends with the mysterious Heathcliff. Where has this strange, silent boy come from? Will you fear him or pity him? What drives the adult Heathcliff to destroy others, even his own son, and to dig in dark graveyards? Is it love or vengeance, or both?

This famous story of Heathcliff and Catherine will thrill you and chill you to the bone.","Nelly Dean has spent her life serving the inhabitants of Wuthering Heights. She has quite a tale to tell. She wants to tell it to you.
